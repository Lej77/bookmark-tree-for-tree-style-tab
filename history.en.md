  - Update to `zh` locale by NightSharp. Thanks!
- 4.3 (2023-10-27)
  - Fix: ensure internal Firefox URLs such as the new tab page (about:newtab) are opened when creating discarded/unloaded tabs.

  - Feature: read tab tree data from [`openerTabId`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/Tab#openertabid) to support [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sidebery/) and potentially other addons that adds tree structure to tabs.
